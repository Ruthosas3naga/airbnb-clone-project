# airbnb-clone-project
<!-- # The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. 
# This project is tailored to enhance your expertise in modern software development practices. By completing these tasks, learners will:

# Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
Implement advanced security measures for API development.
Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem. -->

<!-- Team Roles
backend developer: Builds the server-side logic and infrastructure of a web application,implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.
frontend developer: Front-end developers create the part of an application that users interact with, ensuring that an app offers an equally smooth experience to all—no matter the device, platform, or operational system.
Databas Administrator: Manages and maintains databases used by applications.
Project manager (PM): Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget. Manages and motivates the software development team.
UI/UX designer: Transforms a product vision into user-friendly designs.Creates user journeys for the best user experience and highest conversion rates --> 

<!-- Technology Stack
Django: Handles routing (URLs), views, and templates, Manages databases with its built-in ORM. Includes built-in authentication, admin panel, and security features.
PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database used to store and manage data. It stores structured data (tables, rows). Supports advanced queries, indexing, and data types, ensures data integrity, reliability, and performance.
GraphQL: GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. Allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It reduces over-fetching or under-fetching of data (unlike REST).Provides a single endpoint for querying complex, nested data -->
