# airbnb-clone-project
<!-- # The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. 
# This project is tailored to enhance your expertise in modern software development practices. By completing these tasks, learners will:

# Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
Implement advanced security measures for API development.
Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem. -->

<!-- Team Roles
backend developer: Builds the server-side logic and infrastructure of a web application,implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.
frontend developer: Front-end developers create the part of an application that users interact with, ensuring that an app offers an equally smooth experience to all—no matter the device, platform, or operational system.
Databas Administrator: Manages and maintains databases used by applications.
Project manager (PM): Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget. Manages and motivates the software development team.
UI/UX designer: Transforms a product vision into user-friendly designs.Creates user journeys for the best user experience and highest conversion rates --> 

<!-- Technology Stack
Django: Handles routing (URLs), views, and templates, Manages databases with its built-in ORM. Includes built-in authentication, admin panel, and security features.
PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database used to store and manage data. It stores structured data (tables, rows). Supports advanced queries, indexing, and data types, ensures data integrity, reliability, and performance.
GraphQL: GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. Allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It reduces over-fetching or under-fetching of data (unlike REST).Provides a single endpoint for querying complex, nested data -->

<!-- Database Design
Users:Represents people who use the platform (e.g., renters, property owners).

name: Full name of the user
email: Unique email address
password_hash: Encrypted password
role: Can be renter or owner
Relationships:
A user can list multiple properties
A user can make multiple bookings
A user can leave multiple reviews

Properties: Represents places listed for booking.
id: Unique identifier
title: Name of the property
description: Detailed description
location: Address or city
price_per_night: Cost to rent per night
owner_id: References the id of a user (owner)
Relationships:
A property belongs to one user
A property can have multiple bookings
A property can have multiple reviews

Bookings:Represents reservation information.
id: Unique identifier
user_id: The renter who made the booking
property_id: The property being booked
start_date: Booking start date
end_date: Booking end date
Relationships:
A booking belongs to one user
A booking belongs to one property

Reviews: Represents user feedback on properties.
id: Unique identifier
user_id: Reviewer (user)
property_id: Reviewed property
rating: Numeric score (e.g., 1-5)
comment: Text feedback
Relationships:
A review belongs to one user
A review belongs to one property

Payments:
id: Unique identifier
booking_id: The associated booking
amount: Total payment amount
status: Paid, pending, failed
payment_date: Timestamp of payment
Relationships:
A payment belongs to one booking

Feature Breakdown
1. API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

API Security
Ensuring the security of our API is critical to protect user data, prevent abuse, and maintain trust. Below are the key security measures we will implement:

1. Authentication
We will use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0 to verify the identity of users accessing the API.
Why it's important: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing protected endpoints and ensures only valid users can perform actions like booking properties or making payments.

2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced to distinguish between different user roles (e.g., admin, owner, renter) and their permissions.
Why it's important: Ensures that users can only access and modify resources they own (e.g., an owner should not edit another owner's property).

3. Rate Limiting
Limits the number of requests a user/IP can make in a certain time period using tools like Django Ratelimit or API Gateway throttling.
Why it's important: Prevents abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial of service (DoS) attacks that could degrade service or compromise security.

4. Data Validation & Sanitization
All input from users will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS).
Why it's important: Prevents malicious users from injecting harmful data or scripts into the system.

5. HTTPS Only
The API will only be accessible over HTTPS to ensure encrypted data transmission.
Why it's important: Protects sensitive information like login credentials and payment data from being intercepted.

6. Secure Payment Integration
Payments will be handled via a secure third-party processor (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) with tokenized transactions.
Why it's important: Ensures that financial transactions are protected and reduces our liability for storing sensitive payment information.

7. Logging and Monitoring
All API activity will be logged, and security monitoring will be in place to detect suspicious behavior.
Why it's important: Helps in identifying breaches, debugging issues, and auditing user activity.
